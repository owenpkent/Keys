## [Unreleased]

### Added — Octavium parity overhaul
- **Five playing surfaces**, switchable by an on-screen tab row, replacing Octavium's
  separate windows: **Keys** (the piano), **Hex** (the Harmonic Table), **Pads** (4x4
  note grid), **Faders**, and **XY**. Latch, Sustain, Voices, Octave, Humanize, and
  All Off apply to whichever note surface is up; switching away from a surface
  silences it so nothing rings unseen. Chord pads sit above the tabs and keep
  sounding regardless.
  - **Harmonic Table**: Octavium's isomorphic hex grid (9 rows x 18 columns, C1 at the
    bottom left). Up a row is +7, upper-right +4, upper-left +3, so chord shapes are
    the same everywhere. Every hex sharing a sounding note lights together. Scale Lock
    snaps and dims here exactly like the piano (Octavium's table had no scale
    awareness).
  - **Pad Grid**: 16 note pads from C1, ascending left-to-right bottom-to-top, on its
    own MIDI channel (**Pad Ch**, default 10) so drums land where drum instruments
    listen while the keyboard plays elsewhere. Follows Octave; deliberately ignores
    Scale Lock (snapping would silently swap which drum a pad hits).
  - **Faders**: eight CC faders (defaults: Mod, Volume, Cutoff, Pan, Resonance,
    Attack, Expression, Reverb). The label under each fader reassigns it in one click;
    Octavium needed a menu-bar dialog. Assignments persist; positions are performance
    state and nothing is sent until a fader moves.
  - **XY Pad**: one drag sends two CCs (X default Mod, Y default Cutoff, both
    assignable). Up is more. **Lock X / Lock Y** freeze an axis; **Reset** recentres
    to 64/64 and says so in MIDI.
- **Right-click per-note latch** on the piano, hex grid, and pad grid, at Owen's
  request: right-click toggles a note held, independent of the drag gesture, exactly
  like Octavium. It is an optional accelerator: the on-screen Latch toggle remains the
  left-click path, per the accessibility contract (amended in the kit to say exactly
  that). Unlike Octavium, panic and Latch-off actually clear right-click-latched notes
  (Octavium's survived All Notes Off forever).
- **Markov chord source** in the generator (Source: Algorithmic / Markov): walks
  bigram tables of real progressions per mode (Major / Minor / Modal) with
  **Temperature** (0.30-2.00, conservative to adventurous), **Length** (4-16 unique
  chords, looped to fill the page), a **Mood** filter, and a **Start chord** picker.
  Per-pad **New** regenerates through the chain from the previous pad's numeral.
  The progression corpus is authored fresh for Keys (88 progressions: 30 Major, 30
  Minor, 28 Modal, mood-tagged with Octavium's documented vocabulary): Octavium's
  corpus was never in its repo or installer, so its shipped Markov source silently
  produced I-I-I-I for every user. A corpus lint test parses every numeral, and a
  typo'd chord suffix is a test failure rather than silently becoming a plain triad.
- **Chord pads: 16 per page** (two rows of eight, 64 slots across the 4 pages),
  matching Octavium's 4x4 grid; the generator overlay shows the full 4x4 and Fill
  seeds all seven degrees in order before sampling the other nine. Sessions saved
  with 8-a-page pages load with every pad on the page it was on.
- **Recall**: drag a pad onto the live chord card to latch its notes back onto the
  keyboard (or hex grid) for editing, the reverse of capture. From a non-note surface
  it hops to the piano first so the chord is visible.
- **Suggestion preview**: every entry in the **Next** menu has a play button that
  auditions the suggested chord for 800 ms without closing the menu, like Octavium's.

### Changed
- **Parameter layout changed (loudly)**: 16 parameters added — `surface`,
  `padChannel`, `faderCC1`-`faderCC8`, `xyCCX`, `xyCCY`, `genSource`, `markovMode`,
  `markovTemp`, `markovLength`. Sessions saved before load fine and keep their
  settings; the new parameters take their defaults. Chord-pad slots migrate from
  8-a-page saves automatically.
- **All Off** now sends CC120 (All Sound Off) as well as CC123 on every channel, as
  Octavium's chord-pad panic did, so releasing envelopes cut too.
- The **pitch wheel glides back to centre** over ~160 ms (Octavium's eased return)
  instead of snapping. Both wheels and all CC faders move by **relative drag** and
  never jump to a click, matching Octavium's deliberate slider feel: a stray click
  can't slam a value to an extreme.
- The editor default size grew to 960x600 (minimum 820x480): the playing area now
  flexes to fit the hex grid and pad surfaces; the piano still caps its key height
  and anchors to the bottom.
- **Chord generator** (`Chords` button): fills the chord pads for a key and mode,
  ported from Octavium's Autofill and Options dialogs. Everything Octavium reached by
  right-click is an on-screen button, so it stays mouse-only.
  - 12 **scale modes** with a chord quality per degree (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian,
    Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Locrian, Harmonic/Melodic Minor, Blues, and both
    pentatonics), each showing the character it carries.
  - 10 **Feel presets** (Happy, Sad, Dreamy, Dark, Jazzy, Bluesy, Epic, Chill,
    Mysterious, Smooth): one click sets the generator's key and mode *and* moves Root
    and Scale to match, so Scale Lock agrees with the pads.
  - **Scale Compliance** (0-100%): how far outside the key the generator may reach.
    100% stays diatonic; lower opens up modal interchange, then secondary dominants,
    then any chromatic root.
  - **Lock** a pad to keep it through a regenerate. **Lock Influence** (0-100%) steers
    new chords toward the character of what you locked.
  - **New** gives a pad a different chord for the same scale degree; **Next** offers
    chords that could follow it (Neo-Riemannian P/L/R/N/S/H, circle-of-fifths moves,
    diatonic degrees, and chromatic substitutions) and drops the pick into the next
    free pad.
  - Note-count filter (triads / 7ths / 9ths), inversions (root / 1st / 2nd / 3rd),
    and a generator octave. Press a chord in the grid to audition it.
- **Chord pad pages**: four pages (was a single row of eight pads), with `<` / `>`
  navigation. Chords left ringing on another page keep sounding. (Pages later grew
  to 16 pads each; see the overhaul entry above.)
- **All Off** flashes blue when clicked, matching Octavium.

### Fixed
- **All Off** left the chord pads drawn as active: it silenced the notes but never
  cleared the pads' own state.
- Chord pads ignored the **Voices** limit entirely, since voice stealing lived only in
  the keyboard. A pad now drops its highest notes to fit the cap, keeping the lowest.
- The chord generator's diatonic tier is genuinely diatonic. Octavium offers Sus2 and
  Add9 on every major/minor degree without checking the added note is in the key (E
  Sus2 in C major wants F#), so its "strictly diatonic" setting was not. Ported with
  that filtered, since Keys is built on never playing a wrong note.
- Regenerating a chord no longer breaks the note-count filter. Octavium drops the
  filter when a degree has no alternative, which could return a chord of the wrong size
  or the same chord it was asked to replace.

### Changed
- **Parameter layout changed**: 13 parameters added (`padPage`, and the `gen*` set for
  the generator). Sessions saved with 0.1.0 load and keep their settings; the new
  parameters take their defaults.
- Unit tests now print their failures. JUCE's default logger writes to the debugger,
  so a failing test used to exit non-zero and say nothing.
- `src/ScaleModes.h`, `src/ChordGen.h`, `src/ChordSuggest.h`: generation and suggestion
  logic kept free of UI, so it unit-tests like `NoteMath.h` and `Chords.h`.

### Not ported
- Octavium's **MIDI Library** chord source: it reads the external ~30 MB MIDI chord
  pack, which a plugin has no business shipping or hunting for on disk. (This entry
  previously claimed the **Markov** source shared that dependency; it does not — its
  algorithm is self-contained, and the data it expected never shipped at all. It is
  now ported, with a corpus authored for Keys; see Added.)
- Octavium behaviours found to be bugs and fixed rather than reproduced, beyond the
  two generator fixes below: right-click latches surviving panic; the harmonic
  table's Latch-off orphaning latched notes; the pad grid resolving note-offs at
  release time (a held pad's note-off could target the wrong note after an octave
  change); the fader window silently resetting faders 5-8 on rebuild; Markov's
  note-count and inversion checkboxes silently doing nothing (Keys greys them out
  when the Markov source is active).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Initial Keys plugin: mouse-only playable MIDI keyboard, VST3 + Standalone.
- On-screen piano at 25 / 49 / 61 / 73 / 76 / 88 keys; click to play, drag to glide.
- **Latch** (toggle notes on/off to hold a chord) and **Sustain** (pedal) as
  on-screen toggles, not modifier keys.
- **Scale Lock**: snap played notes to the nearest note in a chosen root and scale;
  out-of-scale keys dimmed.
- Octave shift (-5..+5), velocity with Soft / Linear / Hard curve, MIDI channel 1–16.
- **Mod wheel** (CC1) and **Pitch bend** wheels left of the keyboard; the pitch wheel
  springs back to centre when released.
- **Polyphony** limit (Off / 1–8 voices) with oldest-note voice stealing.
- **Humanize**: each note gets a random velocity within a Min/Max range plus a
  micro-timing offset, an on-screen toggle, so latched or dragged chords feel played
  rather than quantized. With the pedal down, a glide leaves a sustained trail.
- **Chord pads**: build a chord (Latch on, click the notes), drag the live chord card
  onto one of eight pads to capture it (auto-named, e.g. `Cm7`), then play a pad
  beat-pad style: press to fire, release to stop (Sustain holds it). Drag a pad to
  rearrange, or off the row to clear. Exclusive mode
  chokes the previous chord; pads persist with the session. A Strum control (Octavium
  "Drift") spreads a pad's notes over 0-200ms, Up / Down / Random.
- Humanize velocity is a two-handle Min/Max range slider (was two separate sliders).
- **All Off** panic across every channel.
- State (size, scale-lock, root, scale, octave, channel, velocity, curve, sustain,
  latch) persists with the DAW session.
- Fail-closed auto-updater from the shared kit (pinned OK Studio EV cert).
- Build script, Inno Setup installer, and CI (Windows + macOS) off the OK Studio line.
- Unit tests (JUCE UnitTest + ctest) for note resolution; CI builds and runs them.
- `src/NoteMath.h`: note-resolution logic factored out of the keyboard widget so it
  is unit-testable without a UI.
